1. Unable to click to select in fog/move planner/replay/etc.
    Click to select works in standard and hf but the others are coded differently for some reason. Maybe someone smart can fix this...

2. Fast clicking on the inc/dec arrows on input fields can overwhelm the server.
    Could be improved by catching the 503 and waiting before resubmitting.
